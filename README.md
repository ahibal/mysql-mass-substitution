## Extended regex for what you are searching in the database (without capturing groups).

For example \/[a-z-]+2023 will match
/ghjg-gg-ere2023
/hjh-ghg-2023
/hjhhjkh2023
and so on...
Current value is: \/[a-z-]+2023
Enter new value or [Enter] to accept existing value:


## Exactly the same extended regex with or without capturing groups.

For example (\/[a-z-]+)2023 will allow you to use (\/[a-z-]+) as \1 when defining the substitution (next step)
Current value is: (\/[a-z-]+)2023
Enter new value or [Enter] to accept existing value:


## The substitution string (using or not using capturing groups from previous step).

For example \12024 if a match was
++++++---- (+ marks the capture group and - marks the rest of the match)
\ghjg-2023
then the new string will be \ghjg-2024
Current value is: \12024
Enter new value or [Enter] to accept existing value:

I am ready to generate replace.sql file.
Proceed? [y/n]:

Generating replace.sql ...
Done!

Please review replace.sql using your editor, search for the changed strings to confirm that the substitutions are correct. If all is OK then you can apply changes to your database using the following command:
mysql -u forge -p -h 127.0.0.1 forge < replace.sql
If anything wrong you can always revert to initial state using the following command:
mysql -u forge -p -h 127.0.0.1 forge < 2023-05-01-19-51-58.sql
